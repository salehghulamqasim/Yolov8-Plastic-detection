# YOLOv8 Object Detection on Custom Dataset

This repository contains the necessary code and documentation to train a YOLOv8 model for object detection using a custom dataset. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability of YOLOv8 to adapt to specific object recognition tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Overview

The YOLOv8 model is trained on a custom dataset to detect various objects. This project can be used as a reference for anyone interested in implementing real-time object detection systems in different domains such as surveillance, automated inspection, and robotic vision.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset Preparation**: Instructions on how to prepare and format your dataset for training.
- **Model Training**: Scripts and notebooks to train the YOLOv8 model on the custom dataset.
- **Evaluation and Testing**: Tools and metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implementation of a real-time object detection using the trained YOLOv8 model.
